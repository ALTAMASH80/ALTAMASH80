# Laminas MVC Introduction

[Laminas MVC](https://docs.laminas.dev/mvc/) is an open framework which gives a free hand to the development team to build what they want and how they want it. This is good and it is the point which makes Laminas MVC a difficult framework to get your hands dirty in.

What do I mean by an open framework? Laminas is the only framework which doesn't impose anything on you the developers like other MVC frameworks like Symfony or&nbsp; Laravel. With Symfony, you've to learn doctrine and have to get to learn it and use it. Laravel is the same.

For being open-ended Laminas MVC has gone through some serious dislike. This is why it couldn't get accepted by a larger community of PHP. Also, the lack of tutorials just added more salt to the MVC framework disliking. What made Laminas MVC a hated framework?

The problem lies in the word framework. The reason being the Laminas people or the Laminas team failed to distinguish between word framework and component. The main intention of the Laminas people is to introduce Laminas to a wider audience and to be acceptable by a large community. But they ended up confusing the community itself.

Laminas is primarily a collection of components from which the Laminas MVC framework is formed. That is the reason why Laminas was chosen by the Magento team to build their solution in it. When the Laminas team started using the sentence component-based framework this caught the attention of the Symfony team and Laravel team and they also started calling their framework as a component-based framework.

But the word framework is fixated to the MVC approach with the usage of doctrine or any other means of communication with the database via PDO or any custom work done by the framework developed. Therefore, I'll discuss on my blog how to use Laminas MVC framework with doctrine because doctrine has some very interesting components of its own and the Lead of Doctrine is a part of Laminas.

Here, I'll introduce you people with a practical approach which will help you get started to start building your own solutions in Laminas MVC and start developing Laminas MVC modules for your own use and for others. I'll discuss all the things which I've learned in my self-taught usage of this framework. Hopefully, you'll like it, share it and also help me improve. I would encourage you to join [Discourse](https://discourse.laminas.dev/) the official Laminas discussion forum. Thanks!
