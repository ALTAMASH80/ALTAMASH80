- 👋 Hi, I’m @ALTAMASH80
- 👀 I’m interested in Laminas-Mvc, Doctrine and ReactPHP/Swoole.
- 🌱 I’m a PHP developer since Dec-15-2008. But I consider myself as a code monkey not a crafts man. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Laminas. But the pre-requisites are way to tough for me. As they require TDD as a must have skill. :(
- 👀 I know basic of TDD. I've written basic TDD for Laminas-Form. Which was easy, as you can see other people code and copy paste with a bit of brain. :P
- 📫 How to reach me, You guys can contact me via my [contact form](http://www.lrphpt.com/contact). 
- 📫 I work on PHP because people hate it and call it an interpreter language. Which is not true at all. You can see my post [here]([http://www.lrphpt.com/contact](http://www.lrphpt.com/blog/post/view/php-is-not-an-interpreter-language)) about it. Thanks!
