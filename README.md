- 👋 Hi, I’m @ALTAMASH80
- 👀 I’m interested in Laminas-Mvc, Doctrine and ReactPHP/Swoole.
- 🌱 I have been a PHP developer since Dec-15-2008. But I consider myself a code monkey, not a craftsman. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Laminas. But the prerequisites are way too tough for me. As they require TDD as a must-have skill. :(
- 👀 I know the basics of TDD. I've written basic TDD for Laminas-Form. Which was easy, as you can see other people code and copy-paste with a bit of brain. :P 
- 👋 I work on PHP because people hate it and call it an interpreter language. Which is not true at all. You can see my post [here](http://www.lrphpt.com/blog/post/php-is-not-an-interpreter-language/11) about it. Thanks!
