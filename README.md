- 👋 Hi, I’m @ALTAMASH80
- 👀 I’ve worked on Laminas-Mvc, Doctrine.
- 🌱 I have been a PHP developer from Dec-15-2008 and ended in July 2024. But I consider myself a code monkey, not a craftsman. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to a new beginning what it will be I don't know. 
- 👋 I'ved worked on PHP because people hate it and call it an interpreter language. Which is not true at all. You can see my post [here](https://github.com/ALTAMASH80/ALTAMASH80/blob/main/php-is-not-an-interpreter-language.md) about it. Thanks!
